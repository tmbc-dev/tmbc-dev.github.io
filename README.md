## About the Project

**Token Mined by Community (TMBC)** is a crypto project simulating the mining process, where users create virtual mining farms, level up their mining power, and earn TMBC tokens in real-time.

To get started, users need to upgrade their mining level by paying gas fees + a project fee, or by inviting new users via a referral link. Each new user increases the referrer's mining level by 1 and earns the referrer **0.0005 BNB**.

Each **mining level = +0.001 TMBC/s**, with rewards being automatically added to users' balances **every second**.

**Project fees** are used to ensure fairness, primarily to prevent attacks from malicious actors, such as KOGE token owners, who might try to exploit the system. These fees also help enhance the referral program and fund marketing efforts, as well as support future liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX).
